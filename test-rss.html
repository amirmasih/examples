<p>I loved reading Onize Ohikere&#8217;s profile of Mary Slessor for WORLD magazine. I didn&#8217;t know that Slessor&#8217;s house remains open as a museum! It was on my list of potential locations for my EPIC project, but I wasn&#8217;t able to find out if there was a museum there or any historical objects. Nigeria is on my list of places I&#8217;d love to visit and, when I do, I need to get to Calabar!</p>

<p>1 Thessalonians 4 is one of my favorite and most formative chapters. &#8220;Be honest, do you love the conflict? Do you love the argument? If so, be insignificant on social media and preserve your soul. For what use is it to you if you gain all the world’s likes but lose your soul?&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s some solid financial advice in this one. &#8220;In light of all this uncertainty, what is a wise steward to do? Well, I want to introduce you to something called the &#8216;Prudent Man Rule.&#8217; It sounds like something right out of the Bible, but it isn’t. As we shall see, it does align with some biblical principles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some stories seem too good to be true. Some seem too good not to be true. Both seem too good not to be told over and over again. Here are a couple I’m thinking you’ve heard before.&#8221; Have you? And if so, can you verify or disprove them?</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many ways for a church to have a lasting impact on its local community. Perhaps one of the most profound ways is through local schools.&#8221; What a great idea!</p>

<p>What got lost along the way is that the heart of worship is not a great band, a perfect key change, or a soaring chorus, but human voices lifted together to God&#8230;If all we can hear is the band, we’ve completely missed the point.</p>

<p>For nearly thirty years, Charles Woodrow has been serving as a missionary-doctor in Nampula, Mozambique. (All the while he has also served as a conference founder, church planter, theology teacher, bookstore owner, and much more.) For a good part of that time, my church has been supporting him. Recently, on the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the annual pastors&#8217; conference he founded, I traveled to Mozambique to bring him a letter of encouragement and to finally see his work there. He and his family and some of their friends were willing to appear on video to tell some of his story&#8230;</p>

<p>I put a bit of extra time into tracking down <a href="http://www.challies.com/kindle-deals-for-christians" data-wpel-link="internal">Kindle deals</a> today and actually put together a pretty solid list.</p>

<p>&#8220;I’ve come to realize that one of the most underappreciated aspects of the Christian life is ordinary faithfulness. Striving for excellence in the small, mundane tasks that God has given today often seems boring and unsatisfying.&#8221; But it&#8217;s the stuff of real life, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="http://ploughmansrest.com/blog/2019/8/27/a-call-to-contend" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">A Call To Contend</a></h5>
<p>Chris Thomas: &#8220;<span class="highlight">I love the gospel. I imagine you love it too. </span><span class="highlight">I love to preach the gospel.

<p>I had a few of these moments through the summer. &#8220;We turned a corner, and the view opened up. From the porch of the ruined manor house we could see the cultivated gardens around the lake, fading into forests sheltered by distant mountains. We had to stop and stare. My ten year old son summed it up: &#8216;I feel like I need to whisper. I don’t know why.'&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="highlight">For what it’s worth, I have a little heuristic I apply in order to delegate without losing my soul. I have three questions: Is this something I </span><span class="highlight">couldn’t</span><span class="highlight"> do, something I </span><span class="highlight">wouldn’t</span><span class="highlight"> do, or something I </span><span class="highlight">shouldn’t</span><span class="highlight"> do?

<p>Here are back-to-back posts on a common theme. &#8220;Most of the time, it’s a tightness at my shoulder blades that slowly evolves into a pain that creeps up my neck and wraps itself around my head. At other times, it has been a slight tightening in my chest that stretched to the bottom of my throat. Those are typically the sensations I experience when anxiety threatens to ensnare me. The cause of the anxiety or worry changes from season to season. Sometimes it’s a mountain of tasks that need to be completed. Sometimes it’s the reminder of certain fractured relationships in my life. Sometimes it’s the perpetual pressure associated with having a job that is reliant upon raising financial support.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The what-ifs of this world press down on our chests and threaten to take our breath away. They are there in the headlines, in our friends’ prayer requests, on strangers’ social media posts, in our secret thoughts. Fear is an unwelcome and uninvited guest, but nevertheless there it is. Cozy, comfortable, at home even, in our hearts and minds.  Fear is like a security blanket. We wrap ourselves up in it, tight and certain. What would we do without it? We’re so accustomed to its texture, its weight, its presence. What would we hold on to if it weren’t for the what ifs? What would we clamor after, if it’s not to avoid the worst? &#8221;</p>

            This week the blog is sponsored by The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and written by R. Albert Mohler, Jr., President, SBTS. We live in an age rightly described as “post-truth.” It is now fashionable to speak of “truth” as a socially constructed sentiment or emotion. A form of relativism infects our society, surrounding us with millions of people who fail to realize they are moral relativists. At a time when truth is more threatened than ever, we will soon discover &#8230;<p>      <a href="http://sbts.edu/TrustedForTruth" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img class="img-responsive" src="https://www.challies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Aug27Challies-03.png"

<p><em>This week the blog is sponsored by <a href="http://sbts.edu/TrustedForTruth" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</a> and written by R. Albert Mohler, Jr., President, SBTS.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span class="wpsdc-drop-cap">W</span>e live in an age rightly described as “post-truth.” It is now fashionable to speak of “truth” as a socially constructed sentiment or emotion. A form of relativism infects our society, surrounding us with millions of people who fail to realize they are moral relativists. At a time when truth is more threatened than ever, we will soon discover which Christian institutions will crumble and which will take a stand.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In John 17:17, Jesus, in his famous High Priestly Prayer, asks his Father, “Sanctify them in your truth; your Word is truth.” Christ prayed that the Word of God would purify his Church — that the inerrant and infallible Scriptures would make the people of God a holy people. That purpose is our calling, and it is the starting place for all theological education. At </span><a href="http://sbts.edu/TrustedForTruth" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we are called to the faithful stewardship of that truth once for all delivered to the saints.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At a time when other seminaries and institutions attempt to offer as little, they can in order to get the job done most </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Southern Seminary remains determined to do it most </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">faithfully</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. More than anything else, we want Southern Seminary to be trusted for the task of preparing men and women for a lifetime of gospel ministry in the midst of an increasingly hostile world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We pray that Southern Seminary will be trusted, both in this generation and in generations to come. Truth is how God sanctifies Christ’s church. It is only through truth that the gospel is preached and taught, and consequently believed and heard. If we are trusted for anything, may all those living know that this seminary is determined to be Trusted for Truth.</span></p>

<p>&#8220;A pastoral colleague recently bemoaned, &#8216;It feels like I get hammered if I do, and hammered if I don&#8217;t.&#8217; He was referring to the constant pull of our culture these days to &#8216;make a statement&#8217; about the current &#8216;hot topic&#8217; trending on the 24-hour news cycle or on social media. The pull to &#8216;use your platform&#8217; from the pulpit to the blogosphere is an interesting dance for the contemporary pastor because there exists some inherent tensions in pastoral ministry in shepherding the flock, teaching the gospel of grace and truth, and modeling winsome cultural engagement in an increasingly fragmented world.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a challenge here! &#8220;<span class="highlight">The problem is that gentleness, as a fruit of the Spirit, is often mistaken for its placebo, </span><em><span class="highlight">niceness</span></em><span class="highlight">. Gracious words are &#8216;like a honeycomb, sweetness to the soul and health to the body&#8217;</span><span class="highlight"> (Proverbs 16:24), but niceness, like most artificial sweeteners, leaves a sour aftertaste. Niceness masquerades as love but fears men more than God. As a result, niceness almost invariably assigns greater weight to tone than truth, taking up verbal arms only when something &#8216;big&#8217; like substitutionary atonement or the Trinity is on the line—by which point it’s too late.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I am not impressed by young pastors who seem too eager to publish books and speak at big events and build &#8216;a platform.&#8217; They are doing the work of the Lord, which is good. But I’m not impressed. What <em>impresses</em> me is my dad’s daily slogging, year after year, in the power of the Spirit, with no big-deal-ness as the goal or the payoff. This is the pastoral ministry that brings Jesus into the world today, and it takes a lifetime to develop.&#8221; Amen!</p>

<p>Schism may not be exactly what we think it is. &#8220;Schism is a scary, serious word. We often think of a schismatic as someone who has caused a split in a denomination over a hot topic issue or walked away from the church entirely, and these never include ourselves. But John Owen’s teaching on schism reminds us that schism can be much less dramatic than this and thus much easier to fall into without realizing it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="wpsdc-drop-cap">I</span>t has always been one of my favorite proverbs: “Gray hair is a crown of glory; it is gained in a righteous life.” It’s one that clashes hard with Western culture and its glorification of youth. But it’s one that is fully consistent with a biblical worldview and its emphasis on wisdom.</p>



<p>The book of Proverbs is meant to demonstrate two very different ways to live. It contrasts the way of wisdom with the way of folly. In this generalized view of life, the foolish make bad decisions, suffer the consequences, and die young. The wise make good decisions, enjoy the consequences, and live to a ripe old age. The Old Testament views older people not as “elderly” or “senior citizens,” but as “gray-heads.” But because gray hair is associated with long life, which is in turn associated with wisdom, this is an honor, not an insult.</p>



<p>Proverbs 20:29 says, “The glory of young men is their strength, but the splendor of old men is their gray hair.” If you’re helping someone move furniture, you may point to your son and say, “I brought him along to be the muscle.” You are defining him by just one part of his body, but you mean it as a compliment. After all, “the glory of young men is their strength.” But as the years go by and strength fades, <em>that</em> great attribute is replaced by another one. Strength is replaced by wisdom, so that the glory or splendor of old men is their wisdom, which is pictured in gray hair. Young men are great in strength but small in wisdom; old men are small in strength but great in wisdom. God has a place or a role for both.</p>



<p>Of course proverbs are general rules for life, not universal truths. Not everyone who has gray hair is wise, just like not every young man has a glorious set of biceps. There are some weak <em>young</em> men and there are some foolish <em>old</em> men. But the point is clear. While everyone ages and while most will eventually see their hair go gray, only those who are wise—those who have lived a righteous life—are able to consider that gray hair “a crown of glory.”</p>



<p>We need to know that this crown is not a symbol of office but a recognition of achievement. It is not merely bestowed, but has to be earned. This isn’t the kind of crown that’s placed upon the head of a king at his coronation, but the kind of crown that’s placed upon a winner at his victory celebration. And while any crown carries authority, this kind of crown carries authority related to achievement—authority that comes when someone has proven his mastery of something.</p>



<p>If you want to learn chess, no one has more authority to teach it to you than a person who has been crowned a grandmaster. If you want to learn a sport, no one has more authority to teach it to you than a person who has been crowned an MVP. In this proverb, the crown has been given to a person who has mastered the art of living. He has received a crown that recognizes and publicly displays his success at living life. That’s a pretty good crown!</p>



<p>And the Bible calls upon each one of us to earn that crown. In one sense that crown is just given to you whether you like it or not, but in another and more meaningful sense it has to be earned. Everyone ages, but not everyone grows wise. Everyone wears gray hair, but not everyone wears the crown. That crown needs to be earned through a righteous life. And so each of us needs to ask: Am I living the kind of life that will allow that gray hair—that proof that I’ve grown old—to also stand as a symbol that I’ve grown wise, that I’ve lived a righteous life?</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember somebody asking the following question: if you could go to Heaven now, or live a really happy and fulfilled life here on earth and then go to Heaven, what would you say?

<p>&#8220;<span class="highlight">I’ve argued before that </span><span class="highlight">self-control is one of the biggest indicators of Christian character</span><span class="highlight">.

<p>&#8220;We think humility is an impossible burden, but in reality it is as light as a feather. It is pride that makes life gray and drab; humility brings out the color. Why do we get this wrong? I don’t know, but part of the answer might be we simply misunderstand what humility is. Here are two ways we do so, in particular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We need people who are passionate about the gospel, and who therefore may well come across as ‘weird’ to a secular sceptic.

They live healthy, balanced Christian lives, but with full hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am beginning a week of teaching at <a href="https://www.muskokabible.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Muskoka Bible Centre</a>—one of my favorite places in Ontario. As I begin with back-to-back morning services, here is one of those occasional Sunday A La Carte articles.</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/shortage-young-men-churches-affects-marriage/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">How the Shortage of Young Men in Churches Affects Marriage</a></h5>
<p>Joe Carter: &#8220;American churches don’t just have a deficit of men—they have a shortage of unmarried young men. This trend makes it harder for young women find mates who are spiritually compatible.&#8221;</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Was E-mail a Mistake?</a></h5>
<p>Yes, I think it was (and is)! &#8220;The dream of replacing the quick phone call with an even quicker e-mail message didn’t come to fruition; instead, what once could have been resolved in a few minutes on the phone now takes a dozen back-and-forth messages to sort out. With larger groups of people, this increased complexity becomes even more notable. Is an unresponsive colleague just delayed, or is she completely checked out? When has consensus been reached in a group e-mail exchange?&#8221;</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="https://timchester.wordpress.com/2019/08/24/top-ten-tips-on-leading-a-time-of-prayer/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Top Ten Tips on Leading a Time of Prayer</a></h5>
<p>Tim Chester gives ten helpful tips on leading a time of prayer.</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="https://camlhyde.com/blog/2019/8/20/fear-or-faith" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Fear or Faith?</a></h5>
<p>&#8220;I often say that God is sovereign—meaning he is totally in control. Not one thing happens that he is not in control of. Having that level of power could be a very scary thing if it were to fall into the wrong hands. Thankfully, I also know that God is good. That level of power in the right hands could be a great thing. Thankfully, God’s hands are not only the right ones, but the perfect ones.&#8221;</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="http://www.forthegospel.org/3-ways-to-kill-gossip/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">3 Ways to Kill Gossip</a></h5>
<p>This is a sin we need to put to death. &#8220;There are few more sinister and Satanic assaults on the inside of the church than gossip. Like a parasitic demon, it often creeps in under the guise of victimhood; whispering to its host, &#8216;You really need to share your hurts and opinions with someone. It’s the Christian thing to do.&#8217;”</p>
<h5 class="css-ing846"><a href="https://fightoffaithblog.com/2019/08/23/the-reward-of-sin/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">The Reward of Sin</a></h5>
<p>What a vivid illustration!</p>

<p>&#8220;When people walk away from Christianity, there are some common reasons they give. They often stem from an unwillingness to maintain the Bible’s authority in the face of mounting criticism from an increasingly secular world. In some cases, it’s because of morality, other times it’s science, still others it’s the resistance of institutional authority.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is the strangest thing. &#8220;Two comic artists based in the UK and US respectively somehow both created Dennis the Menace at almost the same time, with the first editions of each published on the exact same day, despite neither one knowing anything about what the other was doing.&#8221;</p>
